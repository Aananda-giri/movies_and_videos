## A django app to search and play movies online

<br>

## Notes:
    * I do not support piracy & this project was created only out of curiosity.

    * I neither host nor have any rights to movies that may be listed in the web-page.

    * Recommended to use in private_tab (icognito_tab) of browser.

## Working:


    * Movies are listed and searched using (TMDB API)[https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction].

    * videos are played using urls I got from online.
